# SnapchatChatHistoryCleanup
Neat little script that will make reading snapchats chat history bit easier


1. This program is intended to use only with chat_history.json files that are from snapchats user data

2. Program is set to run file name "chat_history.json" and it will fail if file name changes, so keep that in mind

3. if using vscode, all files must be in same folder and python be set to run in folder where files are located. 
File named "launch.json" can be used to run in folder where file is located

4. if there is letters such as ä or ö, they are replaced with "\u00e4" and "\u00f6" because I were too lazy to implement replacement system
